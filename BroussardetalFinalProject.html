<p>In what follows, we undertake a system analysis and usability study of the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/research/library.html">National Gallery of Art Library</a> <a href="https://library.nga.gov/discovery/search?vid=01NGA_INST:NGA">search system</a>, drawing throughout on the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen heuristics</a>.  The body of our report consists of five main parts:</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Overview of System Technology</li>
<li>Analysis of Search System</li>
<li>Working with Results: Filtering</li>
<li>Working with Results: Metadata and Buttons</li>
<li>Accessibility: Tools and Challenges</li>
</ol>
<p>In the final section of the report, we review the results of the our system analysis through a summary presentation of those results according to Nielsen's heuristics, and we then advance recommendations for changes to the National Gallery of Art Library search system.</p> 
<br>
<br>

<h2>Section 2: Analysis of the Search System</h2>
<p>In this section of the report, we analyze the NGA Library's search system, focusing on basic and advanced searches, and highlight issues that we think merit further consideration.</p>
<p>Our starting point is the library's main search page.</p>
<img src="ScreenshotHomepagetop.PNG" alt="screenshot of the top of the NGA Library search homepage">
<p><p>Our focus is on the 'simple' and 'advanced' search functions.  However, before we turn to those search functions, we wish to note that there are three main options for searches: searches can either be limited to the library, to electronic and digital resources, or to everything.  However, these options are explained only, as it were, below the fold on the search page, so they are not immediately apparent.  The first screenshot below shows the search options; the second shows where those options are explained.</p>

<Let's now consider the simple search function.  Here we begin a search intended for 'Candida Höfer': as can be seen, after typing 'Candida', a number of suggestions appear.  The first suggestions concern whether the search will be limited to the library, electronic and digital resources, or everything; further suggestions concern the continuation 'Candida' and the specific kind of information sought.  Note that unless one was antecedently aware of the various search options, one might well be at a lost here.  This seems to violate both Nielsen heuristic #4 (consistency and standards) and #6 (recognition vs. recall).</p>

<p>We now turn to the advanced search function.  It is implicitly set up for Boolean searching, although it is left to the user to infer that from the structure of the search box.  Here again, Nielsen heuristics #4 and #6 seem to be violated.</p>
<img src="ScreenshotAdvancedSearchBox.PNG" alt="screenshot of advanced search box">
<p>It's worth contrasting the minimal information on offer in the NGA search page with the CUA library catalog, which, like the NGA catalog, uses the Primo Ex Libris VE system.  The CUA catalog offers explanations both of what the searchbox is and how it works, as well as search tips that go beyond Boolean functions.  (The two screenshots that follow illustrate each point in turn.)</p>

<p>This contrast brings us to what we take to be one of the deepest problems with the NGA Library search system: it provides next to no help and documentation (Nielsen heuristic #10), so the user is left to infer how to use the system.  While one might object that this is not a problem, given that the intended users of the NGA Library search system are curators and scholars, this assumption, is, we think, misplaced.  As Bates (2017) observes: "As a rule, people&mdash;including Ph.D. scholars&mdash;develop what search skills they have incidentally to their primary efforts at research or problem-solving and often fail to develop a conscious repertoire of search skills and techniques to help them over difficult stages.”  It should therefore not be assumed that the intended users of the NGA Library search system <i>have</i>developed these skills (p. 2080).</p>

<h2>Summary and Conclusion</h2>
<p>We begin by summarizing the results of the analysis of the NGA Library search system undertaken from the standpoint of Nielsen's heuristics.</p>

<p>We now propose our recommendations for changes to the NGA Library search system.</p>
<ul>
<li>XXXXXXXX</li>
<li>We recommend that the library incorporate detailed help information into its system.  The example below, from the CUA library search system, which, as noted above, is the same technology as the NGA Library search system, provides a good model.</li>
