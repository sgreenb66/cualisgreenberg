<h1>System Analysis & Usability Study of <i>The Tower</i> Archive</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Sean Greenberg</h2>
<h2>LSC 555</h2>
<h2>8 April 2025</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>In what follows, I undertake a system analysis and usability study of the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/site/catholic-university/tower/?so=item_title_str_asc&searchkey=1743853766590">archive</a> of <i>The Tower</i>, the student newspaper of the Catholic University of America.  The discussion consists of two main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analysis of the website using the usability framework of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's heuristics</a>.</li>
<li>A 'mini usability test'.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Part 1 consists of three subsections:</p>
<ol>
<li>A table listing four inputs and outputs of the system.</li>
<li>Analysis of the system according to Nielsen's heuristics with respect to its use for a specific lesson plan.</li>
<li>Summary listing two strengths and two weaknesses of the system.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Part 2&mdash;the 'mini usability test&mdash;consists of a third party's evaluation of how <i>The Tower</i> has changed over time and assessment of their search for material on campus attitudes towards World War II and the Vietnam War, submitted separately.</p>
<p>In the concluding section of the assignment, I compare the results from Parts 1 and 2 with the aim of drawing out similarities and differences between the heuristic analysis and the 'mini-usability test', and I then advance some suggestions for improving the system based on the results of the heuristic analysis and the 'mini-usability test'.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Heuristic Analysis</h2>
<p>In this section, I undertake a heuristic analysis of the archive of <i>The Tower</i> from the standpoint of educators and students interested in integrating material from the archive in the context of a course on religion and politics in America.  The assignment is to find material on birth control and related topics in the archive in order to serve as a starting point for discussion on how that issue is represented in the context of <a href="https://www.catholic.edu/about/mission-history">"the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States,"</a> the only papally chartered university in the United States.  Using this assignment as a starting point, I analyze the system from the standpoint of Nielsen's heuristics.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Heuristic</th>
<th>Analysis</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visibility of System Status</td>
<td>The system does not communicate the status of the search.  This may be due to the fact that the search is undertaken in the JSTOR ecosystem.  Search results are, however, provided promptly; results include snippets of text that give users a glimpse&mdash;albeit only a brief glimpse&mdash;of articles returned by the search.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Match Between System and the Real World</td>
<td>Natural terms in this search context, such as 'abortion', 'birth control', 'contraception', 'condoms', and 'Roe vs. Wade' all yield results.  Search terms must all be enclosed within double quotation marks in order for them to be searched as such and not yield false positives, such as, for example, references to 'control', e.g.,, in the context of 'gun control', of one does not include double quotation marks around the words 'birth control'.  A link to JSTOR's Search Help page is available, but it is somewhat hidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>User Control and Freedom</td>
<td>It is not immediately apparent how to return to the main page after having conducted a search.  Trial and error reveals that one must use the back browser on the web page.  Similarly, it is not apparent how to refine results, for example, if one has searched for 'birth control' but has not enclosed the words within double quotation marks.  One can refine the search using the "search within the results" box, but one has to figure out for oneself that one should do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consistency and Standards</td>
<td>If and only if the user is antecedently familiar with JSTOR and its various search protocols, in particular, how to focus searches through, for example, the use of double quotation marks and truncation, will they be able readily to search the archive; if, however, one is not familiar with JSTOR, trial and error is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Error Prevention</td>
<td>One can only discover errors&mdash;e.g., in one's use of search terms&mdash;by examining the results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recognition Rather than Recall</td>
<td>This is ideal.  Search queries are presented together with results as a reference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</td>
<td>Shortcuts, such as accelerators, personalization, and customization, are not, as far as I can tell, provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</td>
<td>Content is limited to the material accessible via searches and the results of the searches; there is a minimal interface allowing for search refinements&mdash;'search within the results'&mdash;and search help, although, as noted above, the search help tab is somewhat hidden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</td>
<td>When no results emerge from a search, as, for example, when a search time is mistyped&mdash;he.g., in the context of this assignment, 'abortian' is typed instead of 'abortion'&mdash;this is noted in the search results, and suggestions for revising the search are provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>General documentation</td>
<td>Documentation is available.  The nature of the collection is made clear at the top of the home page; the collection is clearly broken down into twenty-nine year groups.  As already noted, while there is a link to search help on the home page it is somewhat hidden.  Although there is an option to refine searches, no information is provided as to how searches can be refined.</td>

<h2>Section 3</h2>
<h2>Summary: Strengths and Weaknesses of the System</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Strengths of the System</h3>
<ul>
<li>The system provides prompt responses to queries: results are immediately shown, along with snippets of text that enable the user to determine, in at least a preliminary fashion, whether the results are relevant to their search, in this case, their search for material relating to topics related to birth control, as can be seen in Figure 1.</li>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Figure 1</h4>
<img src="screenshot 2025-04-06-5.png" alt="screenshot of results from search terms having to do with birth control">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li>When no results are returned, as when, for example, the user searches for 'abortian', it is immediately asked whether there was a spelling error, and additional suggestions for improving the search are offered.  See Figure 2 for an illustration of this point.</li>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Figure 2</h4>

</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Weaknesses of the System</h3>
<ul>
<li>One weakness is that the link to search help on the home page is somewhat tucked away, as illustrated in Figure 3.</li>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Figure 3</h4>
<img src="screenshot 2025-04-08-6.png" alt="screenshot illustrating location of link for search help">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li>A second weakness of the system, related to the first, is that while there is an option to refine search results, no documentation is given on how this process works, and so the user is left to trial and error if they wish to try to refine their search results.  Figure 4 illustrates the interface in question here.</li>

<h3>Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>
<p>Comparison of the results of the heuristic analysis and the 'mini-usability test' confirms that the system is not especially user-friendly: it not only does not engage the user, but it throws roadblocks in their path, by not making it clear just how the system works, and, in particular, how searches should be conducted in the system.  Moreover, it seems that not all material in the archive is actually available to search, as manifest in the fact that the user searching for material on World War II was not able to find any, despite using a range of searches that should, as the user determined when they went through the issues of <i>The Tower</i> corresponding to the years of World War II, have actually yielded results.  I should note that I was surprised at this result, and so I conducted an analogous search of my own for articles that treated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  On the assumption that such an event would have been treated in one of the issues of <i>The Tower</i> published around the date of the assassination, I first looked at issues published around the date of the assassination, November 22, 1963.  I found that there was an article on the front page of the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/community.30548051?searchUri=%2Fsite%2Fcatholic-university%2Ftower%2Fthetower1961-1980-30695430%2F%3FsearchUri%3D%252Fsite%252Fcatholic-university%252Ftower%252F%253Fso%253Ditem_title_str_asc%2526searchkey%253D1744129012439%2526doi%253D10.2307%25252Fcontainer.30695430%26ab_segments%3D0%252Fbasic_search_gsv2%252Fcontrol%26refreqid%3Dfastly-default%253Ae0f647226f3256f8927d2f6f872c5737%26searchkey%3D1744129012439%26so%3Dold%26pagemark%3DeyJwYWdlIjozLCJzdGFydCI6NTAsInRvdGFsIjo0NzV9%26groupefq%3DWyJjb250cmlidXRlZF92aWRlbyIsImNvbnRyaWJ1dGVkX3RleHQiLCJjb250cmlidXRlZF9hdWRpbyIsImNvbnRyaWJ1dGVkX3Bhbm9yYW1hcyIsImNvbnRyaWJ1dGVkX2ltYWdlcyIsImNvbnRyaWJ1dGVkX2NvbnRhaW5lciJd&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A302c67894f3d2903be52c42fe51a10be&seq=1">December, 6, 1963 issue</a> that treated the topic, and, hence, should in principle be accessible to a search.  Because the string 'President John F. Kennedy' appears in the article, I decided to search for it.  However, the search returned <a href="https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=%22Preside+John+F.+Kennedy%22&scope=eyJpZCI6ICIxMDAyMjgyNjciLCAicGFnZU5hbWUiOiAiVGhlIFRvd2VyIiwgInBhZ2VVcmwiOiAiL3NpdGUvY2F0aG9saWMtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS90b3dlci8iLCAidHlwZSI6ICJjb2xsZWN0aW9uIiwgInBvcnRhbE5hbWUiOiAiQ2F0aG9saWMgVW5pdmVyc2l0eSBvZiBBbWVyaWNhIiwgInBvcnRhbFVybCI6ICIvc2l0ZS9jYXRob2xpYy11bml2ZXJzaXR5LyJ9&so=rel">no results</a>.  My preliminary and tentative amateur diagnosis is that some issues were not properly scanned and hence are not searchable, although further investigation would certainly be necessary in order to pinpoint the issue.</p>
<p>If it is indeed the case that there is a problem with the digitization of some of the material in the archive&mdash;such as material relating to President John F. Kennedy's assassination and World War II&mdash;then a first step towards improving the usability of the archive would be to ensure that all issues are properly digitized and searchable.  With respect to usability per se&mdashthe focus of this assignment&mdash;my chief recommendation is to make the system more user-friendly by making more explicit just what the search options are&mdash;or at least making the search help link more visible&mdashand providing some more explanation regarding how one can refine a given search by searching within its results.  The recommendations are linked, because only if all material in the archive is actually searchable will it be the case that changes to the search interface that clarify how searches should be undertaken will actually yield changes in the results of searches undertaken in the system.</p>
