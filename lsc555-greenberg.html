<h1>Remarks on Joan Didion</h1>
<p>
Joan Didion is one of my favorite English prose stylists.  It was recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/05/joan-didion-diary-notes-to-john">reported</a> that some of her diary entries are going to be published.  While Didion herself would probably not have been happy that these diary entries are going to be published--given what she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/11/09/last-words-6">wrote</a> about the publication of a writer's unpublished works, I am nevertheless looking forward to reading them.  (I guess that makes me the kind of person, according to Hemingway, as cited in Didion's piece, "who would cheat a man at cards or rifle his desk or wastebasket or read his personal letters.")
</p>
<p>
If you have never read Joan Didion, I recommend that you start with the following works of nonfiction, despite the fact that she saw herself primarily as a fiction writer who wrote nonfiction in her 'down' time.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</li>
<li>The White Album</li>
<li>Where I Was From</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you decide to try Didion, I'd be very interested to learn what you think of her writing!
