<p>In what follows, I undertake a system analysis of the <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org">HathiTrust Digital Library</a>.  There are two overarching aims of this paper: first, to <i>describe</i> the HathiTrust system, by explaining its history, identifying its intended users, explaining the content of the collection and some of the information and search options made available in it, and presenting the system's technological specifications; second, to <i>analyze</i> the system, by assessing certain of its advantages and disadvantages with respect to completing its mission; I conclude by advancing some suggestions for improvement in light of the discussion of certain disadvantages of the system.  The structure of the paper reflects these two main overarching aims, and therefore the paper itself is divided into two main parts:</p>

<h3>System Background</h3>
<p>A good place to start is with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust">linguistic origin</a> of the name 'HathiTrust'.  The word 'Hathi' derives from the Sanskrit word for 'elephant', an animal associated with long-term memory, wisdom, and strength: these attributes of the elephant are very much in keeping with the overarching goals of HathiTrust, which should emerge from the discussion in this section of the paper. The <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/about/">not-for-profit</a> HathiTrust Digital Library was <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/about/mission-history/">founded</a> in 2008, in the early days of digitization, by thirteen members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation&mdash;largely composed of schools that belong to what is known as the 'Big Ten Conference'&mdash;and the eleven libraries of the University of California system.  HathiTrust's aim was to ensure that digitized collections remain publicly accessible into the future: what's distinctive of HathiTrust is that it seeks to <em>preserve</em>materials, in particular, <em>scholarly</em> materials, and make them as accessible as possible to the <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/documents/hathitrust-users-guide.pdf">scholarly community</a>. Scholars, including students, are therefore the HathiTrust Digital Library's target audience.  As of this writing, there are more than <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/">two hundred member libraries</a> of the HathiTrust; it has the world's largest collection of digitized books, which includes more than <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/">18,000,000 books</a>.</p>
<p>The core of HathiTrust's content is the digitized texts that form its collection: searches provide access to metadata such as bibliographic information on the work in question, its MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) record, as well as, in many cases, access to the full text of the work.  Here's an example of what's available when one searches, for example, for Thomas Mann's novel <i>Buddenbrooks</i>.  (Note that the search defaulted to the original German text of the work: in order to find English translations of <I>Buddenbrooks</I>, one needs to select for the language in an <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ls?a=page&page=advanced">advanced search</a>.)  First, one accesses <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001904259?type%5B%5D=title&lookfor%5B%5D=buddenbrooks&ft=ft/">all of the records for that title</a>.  One can then choose to view one particular <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001904259?type%5B%5D=title&lookfor%5B%5D=buddenbrooks&ft=ft/">catalog entry</a>; one can also gain access to citation formats for the book, its MARC record, and a <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015005757730&seq=9/">'full view' of the text</a>, which enables one to access a scanned image of the text, jump to various sections of the text, undertake a variety of searches on it, download the text itself, and even purchase a copy of the text, provided that it is available for sale online.</p>
<p>HathiTrust provides several different services with respect to its content, all of which are related to its overarching mission of preserving texts and making them broadly accessible in order to serve the scholarly community as a whole.  Reviewers continually <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/services-programs/copyright-review/">examine works</a> in order to determine whether they are in the public domain, and if so, to enable access to those texts. HathiTrust also seeks to make its texts available to readers with <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/services-programs/atrs/">accessibility issues</a> as well as to readers who temporarily <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/services-programs/etas/">do not have access to their libraries</a>.  These initiatives, which fall broadly under the scope of DEI, reflect the HathiTrust's mission of promoting access to texts for all.  There are elements of the HathiTrust system specifically dedicated to professionals: the <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/services-programs/htrc/">HathiTrust Research Center</a>, which focuses on data analytics, enables researchers to 'mine' the library's corpus and to apply advanced <a href="https://analytics.hathitrust.org/">analytics</a> to the works in the collection, thereby promoting the growth of the digital humanities.  The HathiTrust Research Center also enables librarians <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/member-libraries/services-programs/mqip/">to contribute to the development of metadata</a> based on the HathiTrust collection and infrastructure.</p>
<p>I turn now to the <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/preservation/">basics</a> of the HathiTrust technology infrastructure.  HathiTrust's content, which consists of scanned images of books and machine-readable text of those books, is stored and served by two data centers: one is managed by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan and the other, a mirror site is managed by Indiana University in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Each data center has a massive storage center capable of holding 1400 terabytes of data.  (For the sake of comparison, consider that <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/terabyte#:~:text=The%20terabyte%20is%20typically%20used,hold%201%20TB%20of%20information.">a terabyte of data can fit in nearly 730,000 floppy disks and 1500 compact disks</a>.)  HathiTrust manages two kinds of index: a <i>full text index</i>, which enables searches for words or phrases in the digitized books; and a <i>metadata</i> index, which provides the MARC data for books.  It is, I think, noteworthy&mdash;and in keeping with HathiTrust's mission&mdash;that most applications were written in-house and that some of the code is available for viewing.</p>

<h2>Analysis of the System</h2>
<p>This section is divided into two subsections: in the first, I emphasize what I take to be certain positive aspects of the HathiTrust system; in the second, I draw out what I take to be certain of its drawbacks; I conclude by making some recommendations based on the discussion.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Positives of the System</h3>
<p>The positive side is this.  Given the enormous number of texts in the HathiTrust library, in the cases when those texts are <em>viewable</em> and <em>searchable</em>&mdash;and it should be noted that these features are often accessible only to readers affiliated with institutions that have partnered with HathiTrust&mdash;HathiTrust delivers considerable search power to patrons.  In the preceding part of the paper, I provided an overview of HathiTrust search capabilities by appeal to a sample search for Thomas Mann's <i>Buddenbrooks</i>.  I want to provide another example, derived from a search for James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>, to illustrate the sophisticated searches that HathiTrust enables.  Provided that one is accessing HathiTrust from an affiliate instution like the Catholic University of America, one can first search for James Joyce's <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?lookfor=ulysses&searchtype=title&ft=ft&setft=true/"><i>Ulysses</i></a>; one can then search within the chosen edition for references to <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt/search?id=ucbk.ark:/28722/h23r0pv23&q1=molly+bloom&sz=25&start=1&sort=seq&hl=true/">'Molly Bloom'</a>, and get a good general sense of her significance to the work.  While, of course, the results of such searches depend on the wit of the person who initiates the search&mdash;insofar as the keywords used for the search determine the results derived from the search&mdash;the very existence of HathiTrust democratizes information for those users with access to it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Negatives of the System</h3>
<p>I now turn to the negative side.  When taken at face value, the HathiTrust collection seems to be immense: the number of texts in the collection should not, however, be taken at face value.  The HathiTrust collection includes multiple copies of the same work, as can be seen from the results of this <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?lookfor=le+ventre+de+paris&searchtype=title&ft=ft&setft=true/">search</a> for Emile Zola's <i>Le Ventre de Paris</i>; similarly bloated results arise from searches for other works, such as <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?lookfor=crime+and+punishment&searchtype=title&ft=ft&setft=truethis/">this</a> search for Dostoevsky's <i>Crime and Punishment</i>.  Second, numerous books, due to copyright restrictions, are not viewable, although, somewhat unhelpfully, they are searchable.  For example, Margaret Mitchell's <i>Gone with the Wind Letters</i> is <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?type%5B%5D=title&lookfor%5B%5D=gone%20with%20the%20wind%20letters&page=1&pagesize=100&ft=/">not available online</a>, and while one <em>can</em> run a search within the text, for example, for mentions of the word <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015062083434&q1=atlanta&start=1/">'Atlanta'</a>, such a search reveals only all the pages of the book on which that word appears.  It's not at all clear to me what one can do with the results of such a search.  HathiTrust says that such searches <a href="https://hathitrust.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/article/2386591860">"can provide a list of page numbers and how many times the search term appears on those pages," which "can help you identify if a book is relevant,"</a> and elsewhere on the site it is claimed that this feature "can be especially useful to you to help decide if the book is worth buying," but in light of the fact that the search results themselves cannot be viewed&mdash;one can only see on what pages the search term appears on the pages of the edition of the book searched&mdash;I find it rather difficult to see the use for these sorts of results.  Indeed, it seems to me that in order for such results to be useful, one would already have to have a copy of the edition of the book searched, which clashes with HathiTrust's aim of promoting accessibility.  (It should be noted, however, that by using the advanced search function, searches can be restricted to books whose text is <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ls?a=page&page=advanced">accessible</a>.)  The search function itself seems to me to be somewhat&mdash;to use a technical term&mdash;clunky: it only recognizes alternate spellings of names when those spellings are used, and it does not reproduce relevant data when faced with an alternate spelling.  Compare, for example, the results from Amazon when one searches for books by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=DOSTOIEVSKI&i=stripbooks&crid=V4CR0I036W0Z&sprefix=dostoievski%2Cstripbooks%2C110&ref=nb_sb_noss_2/">'Dostoyevsky'</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=DOSTOIEVSKI&i=stripbooks&crid=V4CR0I036W0Z&sprefix=dostoievski%2Cstripbooks%2C110&ref=nb_sb_noss_2/">'Dostoievski'</a> with HathiTrust's results when one searches for <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?lookfor=dostoyevsky&searchtype=author&ft=ft&setft=true/">'Dostoyevsky'</a> and <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?lookfor=dostoievski&searchtype=author&ft=ft&setft=true/">'Dostoievski'</a>.  The lack of <a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/documents/PCC-SCT-Authority-Control-FAQs-Authors-Creators.pdf">authority control</a> makes the overall search process more complicated than it would otherwise be.</p>
<p>I conclude with a couple of recommendations derived from the preceding discussion of certain of the limitations of the HathiTrust library.  It might be worth restricting text searches to works that are accessible, so that the results of those searches can be useful to patrons who do not have a copy of the book.  (Although it should be noted that text searches of works that are not accessible directly via HathiTrust, but to which a user might have access, can be useful to that user.)  I also think that the HathiTrust should, assuming that it is technologically and financially feasible, introduce authority control in order to streamline the search process.</p>
<p>The critical comments and recommendations in this section of the paper are by no means meant as an indictment of HathiTrust: it has certainly already achieved great results, but I think  that it can achieve even greater results than it has to date.</p>
